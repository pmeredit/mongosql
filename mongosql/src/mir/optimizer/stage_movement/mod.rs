/// Stage Movement
///
/// The Stage Movement passes moves stages up in the MIR query plan as high as possible
/// in order to improve the usage of indexes and reduce the number of generated documents.
///
/// Filter and MatchFilter stages are moved both to improve the usage of indexes and reduce the
/// number of computations on documents that are eventually thrown away.
///
/// Sort is moved as high as possible in order to improve index usage.
///
/// Limit and Offset are moved as highly as possible to reduce the number of computations on
/// documents that are eventually thrown away.
///
/// Note that this optimization uses the `field_uses` function which is an exponential algorithm.
/// There is an extremely miniscule chance that this could cause long-running query compilation
/// times. In case we ever see a customer query stuck in the optimization phase for a long time,
/// this is likely a prime candidate to investigate first. The telltale sign for this would be
/// one or more extremely deeply nested field paths in a query (specifically in WHERE, HAVING, or
/// ORDER BY clauses). For example, `... WHERE a.b.c.d....x.y.z.even.further....extreme.nesting`.
